Minimum distance in box units (L_box=1) between particles in the initial configuration is: 0.236 between particles 1 and 2
This is compared to length of σ in box units which is: 0.201

           Starting SEGC Wang Landau Simulation        
Due to the occurence of Λ in the metropolis criterion, this simulation cannot be fully carried out for lennard jonesium and is here specific to Argon
