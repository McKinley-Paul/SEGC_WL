Originally fractional potential was: 

function E_12_frac_LJ(rij_squared_σ::Float64,λ::Int64,λ_max::Int64,ϵ_ξ::Float64,σ_ξ_squared::Float64)::Float64 #  ✅ 
    #= computes interaction between fractional particle and normal LJ particle according to equation 16 of Desgranges 2016. Note that `M` in Desgranges = λ_max + 1 in our notation
    returns energy in lennard jones units
    # takes in ϵ_ξ and σ_ξ_squared instead of precomputing because they only need to be computed 1 time every time λ changes
    # assumes that rij_squared_σ was computed using the correct minimum image PBC 
    =# 

    E_int = (σ_ξ_squared/rij_squared_σ)^6 - (σ_ξ_squared/rij_squared_σ)^3
    E_int = 4*ϵ_ξ*E_int
    return(E_int)
end #E12_frac_lj 


for this one we are changing it to the soft core one LAMMPS uses (https://docs.lammps.org/pair_fep_soft.html)

function E_12_frac_LJ(rij_squared_σ::Float64,λ::Int64,λ_max::Int64,ϵ_ξ::Float64,σ_ξ_squared::Float64)::Float64 #  ✅ 
    #= computes interaction between fractional particle and normal LJ particle according to equation 16 of Desgranges 2016. Note that `M` in Desgranges = λ_max + 1 in our notation
    returns energy in lennard jones units
    # takes in ϵ_ξ and σ_ξ_squared instead of precomputing because they only need to be computed 1 time every time λ changes
    # assumes that rij_squared_σ was computed using the correct minimum image PBC 
    =# 

    # LAMMPS (https://docs.lammps.org/pair_fep_soft.html) softcore one: 
    M = λ_max + 1
    s = λ / M

    r6 = rij_squared_σ^3

    E_int = 1 / (0.5*(1-s)^2 + r6)^2 - 1 / (0.5*(1-s)^2 + r6)

    return 4s * E_int

end #E12_frac_lj
