went into lj.jl and removed the overlap check condition from LJ forces

made this change in potential_1_normal() - commented out overlap check/ just made it so overlap check makes sure the distance is zero
    # first computing interaction with normal particles
    @inbounds for j in 1:N
        if j != i # avoid double counting
            rij_squared_box = euclidean_distance_squared_pbc(ri_box,r_box[j])
            if rij_squared_box < r_cut_squared_box # only evaluate potential if pair is inside cutoff distance
                rij_squared_σ = rij_squared_box  * L_squared_σ   # convert to potential natural units (i.e. lennard jones) to compute the potentials see allen and Tildesly one Note note for explanation why
                if rij_squared_σ != 0.0 # no overlap check but still can't be 0 distance because Lj is undefined/+infty there
                    E_int_σ = E_int_σ + E_12_LJ(rij_squared_σ)  
                else
                    return(typemax(Float64))
                end
                # if rij_squared_σ >  0.5 # close to overlap threshold given by allen and tildesly of potential E > 100, ours is E > 224
                #     E_int_σ = E_int_σ + E_12_LJ(rij_squared_σ)
                # else # if particles overlap quit early and return a huge energy
                #     return(typemax(Float64))
                # end 
            end
        end
